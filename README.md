# React + Vite

This repository is for my final Project in WEB3350 - React Development

In this project, I created an application where the user can create tasks and then mark them as complete. I use React-Router-Dom in order to go from page to page and utilize the FireBase as a database to store my tasks. You are able to uncomplete the tasks and delete them as well. All this was done with Javascript, HTML, and CSS

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
